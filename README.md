## Bootstrap-Portfolio

I made this portfolio to follow best practices using Bootstrap4.
I used codes that are readable and follow a certain structure identifying all the bootsrap requirements.

## CRITERIA

* my project has a navbar with links
* it has a Jumbotron
* it contains projects with links
* it contains media queries
* it contains shadows on hover in footer

## USAGE

Navigating through my page you will realize that the links in the navigation bar all work correctly.
All my projects have a link to access my live applications.
My HTML and CSS respond actively to the specifications required in the project.
